# ResTox software support

ResTox is a respiratory activity measuring system developed by the team of the DEFENSoil project.

The ResTox system comprises a hardware and accompanying software solution. The ResTox instrument employs multiple digital CO<sub>2</sub> measuring sensors based on non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) technology (SEN0220), a waterproof temperature sensor (DS18B20) and a photo transistor light sensor.

The cross-platform ResTox software support written in Kivy enables simple control of the measuring device and storage of sensor output data during the experiments.
